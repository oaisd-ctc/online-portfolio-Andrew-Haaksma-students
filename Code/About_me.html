            In this picture, I am skiing in Colorado where I like to
            spend my time skiing through the trees and meeting new people.
            With that, I don’t like skiing in Colorado but anywhere,
            because going to new places is always so much fun.
            The reason is that doing stuff that gets my heart pumping gives me the
            biggest enjoyment in the world. That is why I also like 
            mountain biking, water sports and so much more,
            because a life with no excitement is just no fun.

            When doing different activities they can sometimes be a rinse 
            and repeat so I like to spice things up. So I decided to do some 
            paragliding in the Swiss Alps. Where we got to stay in a valley
            surrounded by mountains (quick tip most people there speak English)
            where we could first try this but doing fun activities isn’t the 
            only thing I like doing. One thing that me and my whole family do 
            is that we are not allowed to go to any restaurants that we could 
            just go to in America. Food options are limited to the cuisine of 
            the area though I can be a bit of a picky eater. I will suck it up 
            and try it but honestly, it is sometimes the best food I have eaten.

            One of my biggest hobbies is to learn about the Renaissance, learn 
            about mythology, dnd, and go to Renaissance fairs. I don’t exactly 
            know why I love to do this stuff but it always fascinates me on how
            creative people were. Like with creature designs examples like the 
            dragon or unicorn and the stories they told about the Greeks give me 
            a frill of excitement almost like I was a little kid reading a bedtime 
            story. With that, I love going to Renaissance fairs because one thing 
            that they do there is that things are handmade. So not machines made 
            through copying and pasting but hand-knitted clothing melted down 
            steal into different things and so much more. So if you decide to go 
            to a Renaissance fair make sure to have money because they do charge 
            for the time they put into the item. Although it is a price hike, the 
            food there can be some of the most delicious things, especially their 
            pie shakes yum (don’t ask me why but it is there and that does make me happy).
            That is why I love studying this stuff as much as I do.
