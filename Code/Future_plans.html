            My plan has a lot of components to get the result that
            I want but The three main things I want to accomplish
            within the next 12 years are quite simple within three
            different sections taking around 4 years to complete.

            So for right now when I am typing this, I will still be
            in my junior year of high school so before I commit to 
            my plan I have to finish something in high school. That
            thing is the EMS program at the Career Line Tech Center 
            in that program you learn medical information to become 
            familiar with the medical field. Though that's not the
            part I am too interested in, donâ€™t get me wrong it is a
            crucial step in my life but there is something else that 
            I need, and that is the EMS certification exam that they 
            offer for free (not the certification but the Exam). That 
            certification unlocks the next four years of my plan. Then 
            with that certification, I am either going to community 
            college or college to get the next few years of required 
            college done with. Ten during that time I am going to try 
            and join firefighters to get a paycheck as well as get 
            hands-on experience with different medical situations to 
            get me prepared for medical school.

            After that time with getting my basic classes out the way 
            I will be starting up medical school to learn about the 
            field I want to be an Anesthesiologist. With that being 
            said, that is the reason I need to spend twelve years 
            learning and studying medical information. With that said, 
            during these next few years in med school I will be hopefully 
            working as a firefighter (or quit because the pressure of 
            doing medical school and firefighting gets too stressful). 
            With all that said After these four years of medical school 
            will be the real test of if I can go into medical school and 
            that is an actual medical career.

            The final section of my plan is now the most important part 
            and that is being able to work in the work environment of a 
            hospital. There I will be working to be an Anesthesiologist 
            but until then I will be working on patient treatment and 
            studying to work higher on the employment ladder of success. 
            With that being said I would most likely quit my old job as 
            a firefighter and be working at a hospital most of the time. 
            With that, if I ever decide to take another path I can easily 
            do so because of where I am in life. If I decide to go into a 
            different medical field as easily as snapping my fingers. With 
            that being my plan for my future I know it is not the most sound 
            plan with lots of gaps but for now, it is the best plan I got.

            With all of that being said I would also be doing a few 
            side hobbies to give myself some peace of mind. The hobby 
            is coding though I do love coding and what I can with it 
            I prefer it more as a hobby and a passing than an actual career.
